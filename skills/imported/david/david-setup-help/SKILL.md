description: 'Namespaced import of David Ondrej agent skills: Walk the user through
  setting up anything step by step. Use when the user asks for help setting up, configuring,
  installing, or getting something working — "help me set up X", "walk me through
  this", "setup-help". Differentiator: gives one current step at a time, then always
  lists every remaining setup step after each response.. Use via $david-setup-help
  when this upstream workflow is needed inside Maroun''s Stack or Hermes-safe operating

## Stack Import

- Invoke this imported skill as `$david-setup-help`.
- Upstream name: `setup-help`.
- Source metadata and license notice: [references/source.md](references/source.md).
- For broad routing, Hermes/Mookie safety boundaries, or verification choice, start with `$agent-operating-stack` and then use this skill as the focused workflow.


# setup-help

Guide the user through any setup, one step at a time, in plain English.

## Response format (every single response)

1. **Current step** — ONE atomic action. A single click, field, or command — not a checklist. 1–2 lines max. If it needs sub-steps, it's too big: split it and push the rest into "Still remaining". Plain English.
2. A `----` divider.
3. **Still remaining** — a numbered list of the setup steps left after this one. Max 8 items, ever.

Repeat this format for every response until setup is done.

## Rules

- Before the first step, build a complete canonical checklist from the user's outline, repo/docs, current screen, and any discovered prerequisites.
- The **Still remaining** list must never exceed 8 items — more is overwhelming. Track ALL unfinished checklist items internally; if more than 8 remain, show the nearest steps individually and merge the later ones into broader phase-level items so the list stays at 8 or fewer. Never silently drop a required step from internal tracking.
- If a new required step is discovered mid-setup, add it to **Still remaining** immediately in the correct order.
- Before every response, audit the current step plus **Still remaining** against the canonical checklist. If any unfinished step is missing, fix the list before replying.
- Only give instructions for the current step. Do not jump ahead.
- Keep it concise. Short sentences. No filler.
- After the user finishes a step, move the next "remaining" item up to "Current step".
- Update the "Still remaining" list each time as steps get done.
- When nothing remains, say setup is complete instead of showing the list.
