description: ShipSwift recipe library — 89 production-ready SwiftUI recipes for iOS/macOS covering animations (view transitions, particle transitions, change effects, shimmer, confetti, typewriter, 27 Metal shaders), charts (line, bar, donut, radar, heatmap, 3D network graph), UI components (onboarding, alert, stepper, search bar) and full-stack modules (Cognito/Supabase auth, camera, chat, StoreKit subscriptions, CDK infra). Use when building SwiftUI features, adding animations/charts/components, or when the user mentions ShipSwift.

# ShipSwift Recipes

Production-ready SwiftUI implementations you can copy into iOS/macOS apps. Each recipe is a self-contained markdown doc with an architecture overview, full source code, an integration checklist, and known pitfalls.

## How to use

1. **Find a recipe**: read [references/index.md](references/index.md) — the full catalog (89 recipes across animation / chart / component / module) with one-line descriptions.
2. **Read the recipe**: free recipes are bundled locally at `references/<category>/<id>.md`. Always read the full recipe file before writing code — do not improvise from the index line alone.
3. **Integrate**: follow the recipe's integration checklist. Keep the `SW` type prefix and `.sw` view-modifier naming conventions unless the user asks otherwise.

Guidelines:

- Recipes are self-contained: components depend only on small SWUtil helpers, which each recipe inlines or references explicitly.
- When combining recipes (e.g. an onboarding flow from onboarding-view + typewriter-text + confetti), read each recipe fully first, then integrate them together.
- Present catalog browsing results as scannable tables grouped by category, and include recipe IDs so the user can reference them later.

## Latest source on GitHub

The bundled references match the latest ShipSwift release. For the newest source, or for shared utilities not inlined in a recipe, fetch from the public template repo:

- Repo: https://github.com/signerlabs/ShipSwift
- Component paths: `ShipSwift/SWPackage/{SWAnimation,SWChart,SWComponent,SWModule,SWUtil}/`
- Raw file example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signerlabs/ShipSwift/main/ShipSwift/SWPackage/SWAnimation/SWShimmer.swift`

## Pro recipes

5 recipes are Pro tier, marked **Pro** in the index: `subscription-storekit`, `subscription-revenuecat`, `tiktok-tracking`, `subject-lifting`, `export-share`. Their full docs (architecture, integration checklist, pitfalls) are delivered through the ShipSwift MCP server and are not bundled here.

To unlock Pro:

1. Purchase ShipSwift Pro ($89 one-time, lifetime) at https://shipswift.app/pricing to get an API key.
2. Set the key and connect the MCP server (Claude Code example; other tools: see the [repo README](https://github.com/signerlabs/shipswift-skills#shipswift-pro)):

   ```bash
   export SHIPSWIFT_API_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx   # add to ~/.zshrc
   claude mcp add --transport http shipswift https://api.shipswift.app/mcp \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer ${SHIPSWIFT_API_KEY}"
   ```

3. Fetch Pro recipes with the MCP tools `listRecipes` / `searchRecipes` / `getRecipe`.

If the user asks for a Pro recipe and no key/MCP is configured, tell them what the recipe covers (from the index) and point them to https://shipswift.app/pricing. Do not attempt to reconstruct Pro recipe content from memory.

## Recipe combinations that work well

- **Onboarding flow**: onboarding-view + typewriter-text + confetti
- **Analytics dashboard**: line-chart + bar-chart + donut-chart + activity-heatmap
- **AI chat app**: chat + thinking-indicator + markdown-text
- **Social / media feature**: camera + chat + auth-cognito
- **Monetization**: subscription-storekit (Pro) + order-view
