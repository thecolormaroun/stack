## Overview

`SWWallet` is a playful wallet "pocket" that holds a stack of payment cards. Three (or more) cards are tucked into an olive-green pouch from the top opening: the upper half of each card peeks out while the lower half slides behind the wallet's front panel, creating a real "card inserted into a pocket" look. The front panel shows the combined total balance plus a "Total Balance" caption and an eye toggle that reveals or hides every amount at once.

Two states, driven by a single `isRevealed` flag:

1. **Hidden (default)** — cards are tucked deep into the pouch and stacked on top of each other; the total reads as a row of bullets (••••••) and the eye button shows `eye.slash`.
2. **Revealed** — cards spring out one after another into a staggered ladder (first card highest, last card nearest the pocket opening); the total morphs into the real sum (thousands-separated) and the eye button shows `eye`.

The staggered "pop out" is built from a per-card `.animation` modifier with a `.delay(index * 0.07)`, so each card bounces out slightly after the previous one. Number changes use `.contentTransition(.numericText())` so the bullets and digits cross-fade smoothly.

Layering (ZStack, bottom to top):

1. **Card layer** — a `RoundedRectangle` per card carrying a bold text wordmark and its balance. The lower half is intentionally covered by the front panel. `zIndex` keeps the ladder stacked correctly.
2. **Wallet front panel (the pocket)** — an `UnevenRoundedRectangle` filled with `walletColor`, overlapping the lower half of the cards. Its top edge is the pocket opening. The panel carries: white dashed stitching inset along its edge, the big rounded total balance + caption, and the eye toggle button at the bottom center.

**Brand note:** wordmarks are rendered as plain bold `Text` only — no official brand logo image assets are bundled (this is a public repo). Swap the `SWWalletCard.sample` data for your own accounts.

**On `currencyCode`:** amounts are formatted with `.currency(code:)`, so the symbol and grouping follow the supplied ISO currency code and the device locale.

## Usage

```swift
// 1. Default sample cards (Stripe / Wise / PayPal) — tap the eye to reveal
SWWallet()

// 2. Custom cards + a different pouch color
SWWallet(
    cards: [
        SWWalletCard(name: "Cash",    balance: 1_200, tint: .green, foreground: .white),
        SWWalletCard(name: "Savings", balance: 8_400, tint: .blue,  foreground: .white),
        SWWalletCard(name: "Stocks",  balance: 24_900, tint: .orange, foreground: .white)
    ],
    currencyCode: "USD",
    walletColor: Color(red: 0.16, green: 0.21, blue: 0.09) // olive green
)

// 3. Localized currency — symbol and grouping follow the ISO code + device locale
SWWallet(
    cards: SWWalletCard.sample,
    currencyCode: "EUR"
)

// 4. Drop into a finance dashboard header
struct WalletHeader: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            SWWallet()
            Text("Tap the eye to reveal balances")
                .font(.footnote)
                .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
        }
    }
}
```

## Integration Notes

- **Self-contained, zero dependencies** — the file imports only `SwiftUI` and carries its own private `Color` extension. Drop `SWWallet.swift` into your project and it compiles as-is (no `SWUtil` or other ShipSwift files required).
- **Cross-platform** — uses `UnevenRoundedRectangle` (iOS 16+ / macOS 13+) and `.contentTransition(.numericText())`. No `#if os` branches needed in this component.
- **No brand assets bundled** — card wordmarks are plain bold `Text`. To show a real logo, swap the `Text(card.name)` for your own bundled `Image`; this keeps the public template free of trademarked logo files.
- **Currency formatting** — driven entirely by `currencyCode`. The component never hard-codes a `$`; it relies on `.currency(code:)` so the symbol, decimal, and grouping separators respect both the ISO code and the device locale.

## Known Tuning Points

The animation is driven by two paired sets of constants — one for the **collapsed** state and one for the **revealed** state — that control where each card's top edge sits and how cards shrink toward the back. The wallet front panel itself is **fixed** (`pocketTop`); only the cards move. Preview on a real device and nudge these to taste:

**Collapsed (eye closed) — cards visibly stacked in the pocket mouth:**

- **`collapsedBase`** (default `100`) — how deep the front card is inserted into the pocket when closed. Larger sinks the whole stack lower into the pouch; smaller lifts the stack so more of each card shows.
- **`hiddenStep`** (default `16`) — vertical step between card tops in the collapsed state. Keep it small so the cards stay stacked but every card's top edge still peeks out; raise it to spread the closed stack apart.
- **`hiddenScaleStep`** (default `0.05`) — per-step shrink toward the back when collapsed (front card = full size). Larger makes the back cards noticeably smaller in the closed stack.

**Revealed (eye open) — cards spring UP out of the pocket and fan open:**

- **`revealedBase`** (default `4`) — overall up-pop height of the stack when revealed. This is the front card's top offset; **smaller means the cards pop higher** out of the (fixed) pocket. Lower it to push the fan further above the wallet, raise it to keep the fan closer to the pocket mouth.
- **`revealStep`** (default `42`) — the fan spacing between cards when revealed. Increase it to spread the ladder further apart, decrease it to keep the fan tighter. Watch the **back cards' exposed amounts**: too small a step and an upper figure gets clipped by the card in front.
- **`revealScaleStep`** (default `0.11`) — per-step size gradient front-to-back when revealed. The front card (largest `zIndex`) is full size and sits lowest; each card further back shrinks and rises by this amount, so a back card never covers the one in front. Larger exaggerates the depth; set it to `0` for a flat, same-size fan.

**Shared:**

- **`pocketTop`** (default `150`) — fixed top offset of the wallet front panel. The wallet never moves; this just sets where the whole pouch sits in the frame. Adjust together with `collapsedBase` / `revealedBase` so the cards tuck into and pop out of the pocket mouth cleanly.
